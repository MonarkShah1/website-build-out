# Rogers Centre Structural Steel Renovation Project

Canadian Metal Fabricators proudly contributed to the 2023 Rogers Centre renovation, delivering 85 tons of precision-fabricated structural steel components for one of Toronto's most iconic venues.

## Project Overview

When EllisDon Corporation needed a reliable metal fabrication partner for the Rogers Centre renovation, they turned to Canadian Metal Fabricators for our proven track record with large-scale commercial projects. This $450,000 contract required precision fabrication of structural steel components critical to the stadium's modernization efforts.

### Project Scope

The renovation required:
- Custom structural steel beams and supports
- Precision-cut connector plates with complex bolt patterns
- Specialized brackets for new seating installations
- Architectural metalwork for public areas

## Our Approach

### Phase 1: Design Collaboration

Working closely with EllisDon's engineering team, we:
- Reviewed and optimized designs for manufacturability
- Suggested cost-saving alternatives without compromising strength
- Created detailed shop drawings for approval
- Developed a phased delivery schedule to match construction timeline

### Phase 2: Precision Fabrication

Our fabrication process included:

**Laser Cutting**: Using our Trumpf TruLaser system, we cut:
- 250 connector plates with ±0.005" tolerance
- Complex patterns for architectural panels
- Precise bolt holes eliminating field drilling

**CNC Forming**: Our press brake operations produced:
- 45 main support beams with multiple bends
- Custom angles maintaining ±0.5° accuracy
- Formed channels for cable management

**Welding & Assembly**: CWB certified welders completed:
- Full penetration welds on all structural connections
- AWS D1.1 compliant procedures
- 100% visual and 25% ultrasonic testing

### Phase 3: Finishing & Delivery

To ensure longevity:
- Blast cleaning to SSPC-SP 10 near-white metal
- Zinc-rich primer application
- Final powder coating in specified RAL colors
- Just-in-time delivery to minimize site storage

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Tight Installation Windows
**Solution**: We pre-assembled major components in our facility, reducing on-site installation time by 40%.

### Challenge 2: Complex Geometries
**Solution**: Our 3D modeling capabilities allowed us to verify fit before cutting, eliminating costly rework.

### Challenge 3: Accelerated Schedule
**Solution**: By running double shifts and optimizing our production flow, we delivered 2 weeks ahead of schedule.

## Project Results

### Quality Metrics
- **First-pass quality rate**: 99.8%
- **Zero rejected components**
- **All dimensional tolerances met**

### Schedule Performance
- **Started**: May 15, 2023
- **Completed**: August 15, 2023
- **Delivered**: 2 weeks early

### Safety Record
- **Zero injuries or incidents**
- **Full compliance with site safety protocols**
- **Recognition from EllisDon for safety excellence**

## Technical Specifications

### Materials Used
- **A36 Structural Steel**: 65 tons for main support structures
- **Aluminum 6061-T6**: 15 tons for architectural elements
- **Stainless Steel 316**: 5 tons for exposed public areas

### Fabrication Techniques
- **Laser cutting** up to 1" thickness
- **CNC forming** up to 170 tons pressure
- **MIG welding** for structural joints
- **TIG welding** for aluminum and stainless components
